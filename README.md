# static-website tool
This is a repo that has ready-made for a static website.

# It includes

⋅⋅* A gulpfile that has browsersync, supports sass and builds your files for deployment
⋅⋅* A/some json files, for obvious reasons
⋅⋅* And to end it all a some config files
⋅⋅* You can copy the files and use it as boilerplate for you projects

The commands for gulp are
1. `Gulp serve`
⋅⋅⋅ This builds a development server that configs the sass to css and es6 to es5.
⋅⋅⋅ Pretty handy right?

2. `Gulp build`
⋅⋅⋅ This builds all the files for deployment, it minimizes the files and throws them all together so you can easily throw em' on there
